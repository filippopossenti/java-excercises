# Excercise 3

### Objectives
- Familiarise yourself with numeric representations often used in Information Technology
- Develop basic algorithm writing skills
- Acquire basic skills on a frequently used testing technology
- Develop basic TDD methodology skills

### Excercise description

#### Part 1
Write an interface (not a class) with a method that converts a decimal number into an hexadecimal number, represented as
a string.
Write a unit test that will be able to validate an implementation built on top of that interface (use mockito to create
a mock of the missing implementation, for the time being).

#### Part 2
Write a class implementing the interface developed in the previous point. The class must pass the tests previously
developed.
