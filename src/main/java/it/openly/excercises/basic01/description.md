# Excercise 1

### Objectives
- Develop basic algorithm writing skills
- Learn about sorting algorithms
- Learn how to write a unit test

### Excercise description

#### Part 1
Write the body of the empty function in the *SortAlgorithmPart1Impl* class so that it performs the
operation stated by the function name (that is: sort strings). Make sure to sort ascending (A-Z).

Note that Java provides of course brilliant embedded sorting functions. The same applies for many other features you
will encounter over your training. However, as the objective of this excercise is to develop basic algorithm writing
skills, you are not allowed to use the built-in "sort" functions: you have to come up with your own algorithm.

If you don't know something, you are allowed to Google it. For example, you might want to familiarise
yourself with existing sorting algorithms and their properties.

#### Part 2
Write the body of the empty function in the *SortAlgorithmPart2Impl* class so that it performs the
operation stated by the function name (that is: sort strings) but this time, sort descending (Z-A).

#### Part 3
Complete the unit test provided in src/test/java for this excercise and write similar unit tests for
your own algorithms. The objective is to validate your algorithms and make sure they are working as
expected.

#### Bonus
- Make sure that you reach 100% code coverage in IntelliJ IDEA. Remember: the less code the better and code you can
  never hits only generates confusion and distraction. If you can't develop a test that hits a piece of code, then that
  piece of code is most likely useless and should be removed.
- Test the performance of your algorithm against the built-in algorithm of the *BuiltinSortAlgorithmImpl* class. If it
  takes more than 3 times as much, choose a more efficient algorithm (examples: QuickSort, MergeSort, Heap Sort)
